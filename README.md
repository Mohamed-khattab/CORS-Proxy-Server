# CORS-Proxy-Server
CORS Proxy Server in Go This is a lightweight CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) proxy server implemented in Go, designed to facilitate cross-origin requests between web applications and APIs. The server acts as an intermediary, allowing browsers to make requests to APIs that don't support CORS.
